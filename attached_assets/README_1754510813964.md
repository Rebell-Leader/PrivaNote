## Why PrivaNote?

In an era where digital privacy is paramount, many AI meeting assistants compromise data security by sending your sensitive conversations to cloud servers for processing. PrivaNote offers a fundamentally different approach:

*   **Uncompromised Privacy:** Your meeting data never leaves your device. All transcription and AI processing are performed locally, giving you complete control and peace of mind.
*   **Cost-Effective:** By leveraging local, open-source models, PrivaNote eliminates the recurring subscription fees associated with cloud-based AI services.
*   **Open Source Transparency:** The entire codebase is open and auditable, fostering trust and allowing the community to contribute to its development and ensure its security.
*   **Tailored for Professionals:** Designed to meet the demanding needs of founders, recruiters, sales professionals, investors, and managers, helping them to focus on conversations and make data-driven decisions.
*   **Future-Proof:** Built on a flexible architecture that allows for easy integration of new local AI models and advanced features as they emerge.

## Technology Stack

PrivaNote is built with a robust and modern technology stack to ensure cross-platform compatibility, local processing, and a responsive user experience:

*   **Electron:** For building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
*   **Node.js:** Powers the backend logic of the Electron application, enabling system-level interactions.
*   **`whisper.cpp`:** A highly optimized C/C++ port of OpenAI's Whisper model for efficient and accurate local speech-to-text transcription.
*   **Google Gemma 3n e4b:** A lightweight, state-of-the-art generative AI model for local inference, handling summarization, action item extraction, decision identification, and text structuring.
*   **Python (for AI model integration):** Potentially used for wrapping Gemma 3n e4b inference or for specific data processing tasks, integrated via Node.js child processes or native modules.
*   **HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend):** Standard web technologies for building the user interface.




## Installation

Detailed installation instructions will be provided upon the first release. In the meantime, here's a general overview:

1.  **Download the latest release:** Visit our [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Rebell-Leader/PrivaNote/releases) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2.  **Run the installer:** Follow the on-screen instructions to install PrivaNote.
3.  **Model Download:** Upon first launch, PrivaNote will guide you through downloading the necessary `whisper.cpp` and Gemma 3n e4b models. Ensure you have an active internet connection for this initial setup.




## Usage

1.  **Start a Recording:** Open PrivaNote and click the "Start Recording" button. The application will begin capturing audio from your system and microphone.
2.  **Conduct Your Meeting:** Focus on your conversation. PrivaNote works silently in the background.
3.  **Stop Recording:** Click the "Stop Recording" button when your meeting concludes.
4.  **Process Notes:** PrivaNote will automatically transcribe the audio using `whisper.cpp` and then process the transcript with Gemma 3n e4b to generate a summary, extract action items, and identify key decisions.
5.  **Review and Export:** Review the generated notes within the application. You can then export them as a Markdown file to integrate with your preferred knowledge management system (e.g., Notion, Confluence, Obsidian).
